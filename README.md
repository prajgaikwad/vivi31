# vivi31 - Music Recommendation App

vivi31 is a web application that generates personalized music recommendations based on a single song input. Using the Spotify Web API, it analyzes audio features and metadata to create a curated playlist of similar tracks.

## Features

- üîç Analyze audio features of the selected track
- üéß Generate recommendations based on sonic similarity
- üíæ Save recommendations as a Spotify playlist
- üì± Responsive design for all devices

## How It Works

1. User authenticates with their Spotify account
2. User searches and selects a "seed" track
3. App fetches audio features (tempo, energy, danceability, etc.) of the selected track
4. App requests recommendations from Spotify API based on these features
5. User can save the recommendations as a new playlist on their Spotify account
